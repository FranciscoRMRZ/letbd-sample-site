          When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting poder stashes on
          his snowboard, you cn find Lee in front of his computer designing interfaces,
          doing front-end development, or writing some of the interface-related
          Learn Enough tutorials.

          You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
          Kimmel, Connan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd 
          at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a 
          tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
